<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ex vivo</li><li>In Vivo</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapy products are categorized into two primary market types: ex vivo and in vivo. Ex vivo gene therapy involves modifying a patient's cells outside the body before reintroducing them, allowing for precise treatment of specific conditions. In contrast, in vivo gene therapy delivers therapeutic genes directly into the patient's body, targeting affected tissues or organs for immediate therapeutic effect. Both approaches aim to treat genetic disorders, improve patient outcomes, and advance the field of personalized medicine.</p></p>
