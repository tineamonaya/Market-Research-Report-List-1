<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Volume Mode Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Volume Mode Neonatal Ventilators market comprises two primary types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators involve the placement of an endotracheal tube to directly administer breaths to neonates, ensuring precise control of tidal volume and airway pressure. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, deliver respiratory support through masks or prongs, providing assistance without intubation. Each type addresses specific clinical needs, balancing the requirements for respiratory support with considerations for patient comfort and safety in neonatal care.</p></p>
