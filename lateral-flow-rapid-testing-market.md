<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lateral Flow Rapid Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sandwich Immunoassay</li><li>Competitive Immunoassay</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lateral flow rapid testing market primarily includes two types: sandwich immunoassays and competitive immunoassays. Sandwich immunoassays detect specific antigens by using two antibodies, resulting in a strong signal when the target is present, allowing for high sensitivity. In contrast, competitive immunoassays work by measuring the concentration of an analyte by competition between a labeled antigen and the target, leading to an inverse relationship between the signal and target concentration. Both methods are crucial for rapid diagnostics across various applications.</p></p>
