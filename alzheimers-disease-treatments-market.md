<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alzheimer's Disease Treatments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cholinesterase Inhibitors</li><li>NMDA Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Alzheimer's Disease treatments market primarily comprises two types: cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA antagonists. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil and rivastigmine, aim to enhance communication between nerve cells by increasing levels of acetylcholine, improving cognitive function in mild to moderate Alzheimer's. NMDA antagonists, like memantine, work by regulating glutamate activity, which helps prevent neuronal damage from excessive stimulation. These treatments target different aspects of the disease, offering symptomatic relief and potentially slowing its progression.</p></p>
